# 🚀 52 Weeks. 52 Projects. Built in Public.

A personal challenge to build **one real project every week for 52 weeks**—documented, shared on GitHub, and learned in public.

## 📋 Overview

This is my commitment to:
- Replace passive learning with **execution**
- Build verifiable **proof of work**
- Explore real-world problems at the intersection of **engineering, data, and AI**
- Develop consistency through a **system**, not motivation

## 🧩 Submit a Problem Statement

Have an interesting problem, dataset, or workflow you want explored?

👉 **[Submit it via GitHub Issues](../../issues/new?labels=problem-submission)** (use the provided template).

Selected problems will be:
- Solved as part of the **52 Weeks × 52 Projects** challenge
- Fully documented with code and explanations
- Credited to the contributor

This repository is built around **learning in public, real problems, real solutions**.

## 🧩 Project Scope

Each week's project falls into one of these categories:
- 🤖 **Machine Learning & Data Science** - Models, predictions, analysis
- ⚙️ **Engineering Analysis & Simulations** - FEA, thermodynamics, robotics
- 🔧 **Automation & Tooling** - Scripts, CLI tools, productivity systems
- 📦 **Open-source Experiments** - Libraries, frameworks, contributions
- 🧠 **Learning & Productivity Systems** - Personal projects that solve real problems

## 📁 Project Structure

Each week's project follows this structure:

```
week-NN-project-name/
├── README.md                 # Problem statement & findings
├── src/                      # Source code
│   ├── main.py
│   └── utils.py
├── notebooks/                # Jupyter notebooks (if applicable)
│   └── exploration.ipynb
├── data/                     # Sample datasets
├── results/                  # Output, visualizations
└── requirements.txt          # Dependencies
```

Each README includes:
- **Problem Statement** - What was the challenge?
- **Approach** - How did I solve it?
- **Key Insights** - What did I learn?
- **Trade-offs** - What compromises were made?
- **Future Improvements** - What's next?

## 📊 Progress Tracking

| Week | Project | Category | Status | Link |
|------|---------|----------|--------|------|
| 1 | System Setup | Engineering | 🔄 Upcoming | [projects/week-01](./week-01-coming-soon) |
| 2 | Data Preprocessing | ML & Data Science | 🟡 In Progress | [week-2](./week-2) || ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## 🤝 Collaboration Welcome

Have a problem statement, dataset, or workflow worth exploring? Share it:
- Open an **Issue** with problem details
- Or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com) / [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com)

If selected, I'll build a project around it and **credit you** in the week's README.

## 🎯 Key Principles

✅ **No perfection.** Just consistency.  
✅ **Real problems.** Not toys or tutorials.  
✅ **Public learning.** Share the journey, not just the destination.  
✅ **Documented.** Every project has a README and reflection.  
✅ **Verifiable.** Code + results on GitHub.  

## 📚 Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C++, SQL
- **ML/Data**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Engineering**: FEA (ANSYS/Abaqus), Arduino, MATLAB
- **Tools**: Git, Jupyter, VS Code, Google Colab
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## 🔗 Connect

- **GitHub**: [@Ajay-Sankar-T](https://github.com/Ajay-Sankar-T)
